# Gladiator Pits

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/e4l064rgu0fe5hax?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/servusDei2018/gladiatorpits-mud)

(A Go rewrite is available [here](https://github.com/servusDei2018/GladiatorPits-Go).)

### Building

This is a slightly modified version of the [original](https://github.com/servusdei2018/GladiatorPits-MUD/tree/original) source, modified only insofar as to make it compile on modern distros, and includes a Makefile.

To build, just run `make`.

### History

Gladiator Pits is a [MUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD), written by Richard Woolcock, who wrote the now-famous [GodWars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GodWars) codebase.

Popular in the 20th century, MUDs are text-baased Multi-player games, similar to our modern day MMOs.

Gladiator Pits, of which this source code is the only public version (to my knowledge) still available, is a excellent example of a MUD, clearly commented, with precision and intuitivity.

### License

Richard Woolcock wrote in `glad.txt`, <blockquote>This code is copyrighted to me, however you're welcome to use it for anything 
you wish, so long as you don't remove the copyright notices from any source 
files containing any of the mud source code.</blockquote>

And therefore, the most applicable license appears to be the MIT license.

### Disclaimer

I in no way claim authorship, nor authority, over this excellent piece of code,
but release it, under its author's original terms and conditions, to the general
public.
